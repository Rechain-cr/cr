Alanine-Serine-Cysteine Transporter 2 (ASCT2) is a Na+-dependent membrane transport protein responsible for cellular uptake of extracellular glutamine.
ASCT2 shows significant high-level expression in various cancers such as breast and lung cancer, where tumor cells upregulate ASCT2 expression to obtain a
large amount of glutamine and thus maintaining the energy demand for tumor overgrowth. Studies have shown that knockout of the ASCT2 gene or drug
inhibition can slow tumor proliferation and provide potential therapeutic strategies for cancer treatment. Among them, ASCT2 inhibitors can reduce the uptake
of glutamine in tumor cells by inhibiting substrate binding, starving tumor cells, and leading to their death. However, currently, research on small molecule
inhibitors of ASCT2 is still in the early stages, and no molecules have entered clinical trials.
